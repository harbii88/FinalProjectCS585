# FinalProject

This project is to automatic grading using a new annotation, @Grade, which will check the result of function. 

I create a new annotation which receive either add or sort. This annotation will determine the check process.

The student should add their name, number and the class object that contain the annotation, After checking code the result will save locally.

The result can be viewed locally by typing: http://localhost:8080/grades.
